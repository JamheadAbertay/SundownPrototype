commit 12130fcd008e511b36c1dcec655262689d2394d3
Author: Gary <GaryWhittle19@gmail.com>
Date:   Sat May 4 18:02:48 2019 +0100

    Added a new narrative "book" mechanic as requested by designers. Removed some old classes. Made some quick changes to level two and placed example of narrative spline in level three.
    
    Narrative spline - set points along a spline for a narrative object to follow and rest at until the bird catches up to each resting point. Example is in level three, flaming boat style. Narrator audio cues can be added easily.
    BP should be straightforward enough to use - set the points for the book to go to for story points 1, 2 and 3. After player reaching the third point of resting, book will travel to end of spline so maybe have it travel somewhere out of sight/ towards the end of the level.
    Be sure to set the spline points that represent the correct places you want the book to rest, in the correct order (1, then 2, then 3). Also remember to set static mesh and particle system.

    Corrected acceleration (again?), removed unused variables, changed camera dive weighting slightly, changed the devlevel so it can run 60fps on my laptop.
    
    BUGS NEEDING FIXED:
    - Spline camera goes back to start the transitions! SOLUTION: Use a delay and set it back to the start after a few seconds.
    - FPS's less than 60 have a significant impact on how the moments spline works, as well as character turning (speeds up on slower FPS's). SOLUTION: Investigate making movement more frame-safe.
    - I'm on a train, woooooo

    - Copied in engine cone to use for collision cone
    - Made lava look a little better (I think)

    Implemented Moment #01. Disabled boosting for Puny - easily enabled again, but we should reconsider how the mechanic works. Level pace is much better without boosting...
    Moments (BirdSplineBP) work alongside SequenceTriggerBP. They will only work if the player is on a spline, currently.
    Polished first level for uploading to Puny's drive.

    UPDATES: Camera turn rate can now be increased in relation to max forward speed. Look for YawRateMultiplier and PitchRateMultiplier in BirdPawnBP to fiddle about - be cautious, high values make the camera move too fast.
    FIXES: Cavan worked out that the reason we couldn't switch camera to a brazier or place more than one moments spline in the level is because in the spline tick I was constantly setting the view target to the character if the character wasn't on *that* particular spline - meaning two would cancel out as one would always be setting the view target to Cinder. Fixed now!

    Made some important changes fixes: the birdspline if in tick in birdpaw.cpp was causing a weird glitch on the moments spline - fixed by removing if statement. Also changed the default FOV, and made the camera shake more gradual.
    
    Notes - DiveRangeClamped goes from 100 to 50, not the other way around.

commit 57feaf71a85b5b00c81920031243025e823bee34
Author: Gary <GaryWhittle19@gmail.com>
Date:   Sun Mar 31 16:29:38 2019 +0100

    Resized Cinder as they were too small, added more brazier functionality (cinematic camera, bird can enter/leave brazier now using a temporary timer setup - this will need reworked to be part of the brazier interface instead of being based on FTimers). Need to get the brazier animated Cinder model, and also create the UI to be used for the brazier storyboards. Added CinematicCamera to the build.cs so we can use it with C++.
    
    First level has all the mechanics currently in our game - hoops, collectibles, and a "working" brazier. Cinder can boost and maintain dive momentum. The moments can now be implemented using the BirdSpline class and Scott's matinee trigger class (may need reworked as matinees are a bit dated). This is the current state of the game's mechanics.

    Edited brazier class (trigger) to place Cinder below the map. Next steps:
    - Change camera to a cinematic view from behind fake brazier Cinder.
    - Take-off functionality (press A to take off).
    - Put fake Cinder (animated sitting) on the brazier.

Date:   Thu Mar 28 18:30:08 2019 +0000

    Added designer values for tweaking turn interpolation values, which affects how fast the bird can turn. Lower values are slower. Also hard-coded momentum from downwards velocity, which can speed the bird up to max speed (the same as boost). A few other settings have been added to the blueprint, read the documentation of each to see what they do.
    
    Spline now just changes control rotation, next steps are allowing up/down/left/right movement and adding the dynamic camera functionality.

commit 52271e54c1bea21cd952272a19f8400fc8ba4292
Author: Gary <GaryWhittle19@gmail.com>
Date:   Sat Mar 23 17:22:41 2019 +0000

    Cavan refined the water materials, I made the boost actually editable now (forgot to assign correct variables), and boost now has a cooldown variable (in seconds). Also added some mountains to hide the ocean edge to the left of the spawn area, and tidied up some areas of the map. Deleted unnecessary landscape areas behind the cave at the end.

Author: Gary <GaryWhittle19@gmail.com>
Date:   Fri Mar 22 17:20:42 2019 +0000

    Modified the boost code to allow designers to tweak BoostSpeed, BoostMultiplier (how fast we reach max boost), and SlowdownMultiplier (how fast we go back to normal speed).

commit 0bdd86cca14c2d8e7d7d3e241c773a5d487b99bc
Author: Gary <GaryWhittle19@gmail.com>
Date:   Fri Mar 22 15:51:00 2019 +0000

    Developed initial boost mechanic using MaxWalkSpeed - this means that we could also perhaps restructure to apply momentum from diving using MaxWalkSpeed too, rather than working with acceleration which has been temperamental so far. SPACE or A BUTTON to boost. Boost is a tap right now - can make hold, release, or refine it into anything.
    
    NEXT STEPS:
    Add tools for designers to tweak boost.
    Clean up C++ of birdpawn as a lot has been worked on recently and it could do with a quick read-over and re-commenting.

    Restructured BirdPawn class to inherit from Pawn again. Got basic collision working using static invisible sphere mesh, updated spline rotation with RInterpTo for smoother spline movement.

Date:   Wed Feb 6 13:24:17 2019 +0000

    Further work on collision. Collision is detected on hit and a normal is constructed between root components. This isn't working, likely because the root components don't necessarily represent the best locations to construct a normal from.

Date:   Wed Nov 21 20:36:02 2018 +0000

    Updated BirdPawn to inherit from ACharacter instead of APawn. Updated flight mechanics for rough feel of pitch limits (can't fly vertically up, can't fly straight down then upside down). Need to revise new mechanics - turning left and right is causing problems with the pitch limits.
